Lightweight code UI for dev blogs. Automatically adds Prism.js syntax highlighting, copy buttons, and language labels to Gutenberg code blocks‚Äîzero configuration needed.

== Description ==

**Alox Code+** is a minimal, fast, and developer-friendly enhancement for Gutenberg code blocks. It adds syntax highlighting using Prism.js, a visible language badge, and a one-click copy-to-clipboard button ‚Äî all with zero configuration required.

**Features:**

  Detects `language-xxx` classes and loads only required Prism components.

- üé® **Beautiful, Theme-Aware UI**
  Includes copy button + language badge styled for light and dark modes.

- üß† **Smart Defaults, No Bloat**
  Ships with common languages (PHP, JS, CSS, SQL, Bash, JSON) and supports filters for customization.

- ‚úÖ **Clipboard Support with Fallback**
  Uses the modern Clipboard API with graceful fallback for older browsers.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Extensible for Developers**
  Includes filters to override Prism CDN, theme, and language list.

3. Add a Gutenberg **Code** block, and add a class like `language-php`, `language-js`, etc.
4. The plugin auto-detects the language and adds highlighting, a badge, and a copy button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
